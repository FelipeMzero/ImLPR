Welcome to ImLPR, a project that fuses LiDAR place recognition with the power of modern vision foundation models. The goal is simple: help autonomous systems localize themselves by recognizing previously seen places, even in challenging environments where lighting or sensor modality might vary. Built with a focus on reliability and practicality, ImLPR behaves as a bridge between traditional LiDAR-based localization and modern visual understanding, enabling robust localization in real-world settings.

If you want to explore the latest build artifacts, you can browse the releases page. See the releases at https://github.com/FelipeMzero/ImLPR/releases for binaries, models, and sample data. For quick access, you can also visit the releases page later in this README. The project is designed to be approachable for researchers and practitioners alike, with clear guidelines for setup, usage, and contribution.

Overview
- ImLPR stands for LiDAR Place Recognition. It is driven by a vision foundation model at its core, but its primary function is geometric localization in 3D space using LiDAR data. The fusion of LiDAR geometry with learned visual representations enables robust recognition of places across time, weather, and scene changes.
- The system targets robotics, autonomous vehicles, and mapping workflows where long-term place recognition matters. It is especially useful when scenes evolve, when lidar scans are partial, or when the environment presents repetitive features that confuse purely geometric methods.

Why ImLPR
- Robustness across sensors: By leveraging a vision foundation model, ImLPR captures semantic and contextual cues that are often stable across time, complementing geometric cues from LiDAR.
- Flexibility: The framework supports multiple LiDAR configurations and can fuse imagery when available, providing graceful degradation when data is partial or noisy.
- Reproducibility: The project emphasizes reproducible experiments, well-documented datasets, and transparent benchmarks so researchers can compare methods consistently.
- Open development: ImLPR encourages collaboration, inclusion of diverse datasets, and transparent evaluation to accelerate progress in place recognition research.

Key Concepts
- Place recognition in 3D: The core task is to determine whether a current LiDAR observation corresponds to a place seen before, and to retrieve its previous pose when possible.
- Vision foundation integration: A broad, pretrained visual model is used to extract robust representations from aligned sensor data, increasing recognition reliability in cluttered scenes.
- Sensor fusion strategy: The pipeline gracefully integrates LiDAR with optional imagery, using robust feature matching and probabilistic fusion to decide matches.
- End-to-end pipeline: Data ingest, feature extraction, matching, verification, and pose estimation flow as a cohesive system designed for real-time or near-real-time operation.

Core components and architecture
- Data module: Handles LiDAR point clouds, optional meshes, and optional image data. It supports common formats like LAS, LAZ, PCD, and binary LiDAR dumps, with preprocessing steps such as downsampling, frame alignment, and coordinate normalization.
- Feature extractor: A vision foundation model backbone adapted to work with 3D data, producing robust embeddings that help distinguish places even when LiDAR geometry alone is ambiguous.
- Matching engine: A robust matcher that aligns current observations with a database of prior places. It uses a combination of geometric verification and learned similarity scoring to reduce false positives.
- Pose estimator: When a match is found, a pose is estimated or refined using LiDAR geometry and, if available, camera extrinsics. This yields a usable localization hypothesis for downstream tasks.
- Evaluation suite: Tools for benchmarking recall, precision, and localization accuracy under varied conditions, datasets, and configurations.

Getting started
Prerequisites
- A 64-bit Linux or Windows environment with a modern CPU.
- A CUDA-enabled GPU for accelerated inference if you plan to run the vision foundation model on-device.
- Python 3.8–3.11 (or as specified in the requirements).
- Libraries for scientific computing and 3D data processing (NumPy, SciPy, Open3D, PyTorch, etc.).
- Enough storage for datasets, models, and intermediate results. LiDAR data tends to be large, so plan accordingly.

Install and run
- Clone the repository:
  - git clone https://github.com/FelipeMzero/ImLPR.git
  - cd ImLPR
- Set up a virtual environment:
  - python -m venv env
  - source env/bin/activate  # On Windows use env\\Scripts\\activate
- Install dependencies:
  - pip install -r requirements.txt
  - If you plan to use CUDA, ensure you have a compatible CUDA toolkit installed and use a version of PyTorch that matches your CUDA version.
- Obtain models and data:
  - The project relies on a vision foundation model and LiDAR processing components. Depending on your setup, you may download pretrained weights and sample data from the releases page or your own data repository. See the Releases section for details about artifacts and how to obtain them from the release store at https://github.com/FelipeMzero/ImLPR/releases.
- Quick start:
  - Prepare a small sample dataset that includes synchronized LiDAR frames and optional images.
  - Run the main pipeline entry:
    - python -m imlpr.cli.run --config configs/sample_config.yaml --data /path/to/sample_data
  - If you provide an image stream, you can enable the fusion mode to leverage visual features.
  - The CLI will print progress, log warnings, and emit results to a results directory.

Quickstart walkthrough
- Step 1: Data ingestion
  - The data module expects a directory with your LiDAR scans and, optionally, corresponding camera frames. If you work with a single sensor, you can disable the image pathway and run a LiDAR-only mode.
- Step 2: Feature extraction
  - Each frame is passed through a vision foundation model to generate a robust embedding. The embedding represents semantic information and scene context, which helps disambiguate places that share similar 3D geometry.
- Step 3: Matching
  - The system compares current embeddings with a database of previously observed places. A scoring mechanism combines visual similarity with geometric plausibility.
- Step 4: Verification and pose estimation
  - The top candidate matches undergo geometric verification. If a match passes, a pose is estimated or refined, giving you a usable localization for navigation or mapping tasks.
- Step 5: Output and logging
  - Localization hypotheses, match scores, and diagnostic data are written to the results folder. You can visualize trajectories, matches, and confidence maps to understand system behavior.

Usage patterns
- Real-time or near-real-time use: The pipeline is designed to be efficient, but hardware will determine the real-time capabilities. A modern GPU helps with the vision foundation model inference; a fast CPU supports the rest of the pipeline.
- Batch processing: For research studies, you can run ImLPR on collected sequences to evaluate performance, perform ablations, or generate reproducible benchmarks.
- Research and experimentation: The modular design invites experimentation with different backbones, fusion strategies, and matching algorithms. If you want to swap in a different model or adjust fusion weights, you can do so through configuration files.
