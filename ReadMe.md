### Recent Updates
- [2025/08/11] First release of ImLPR repository! 

### Contributions
Our work makes the following contributions:
1. **ImLPR is the first LPR pipeline using a VFM while retaining the majority of pre-trained knowledge**: Our key innovation lies in a tailored three-channel RIV representation and lightweight convolutional adapters, which seamlessly bridge the 3D LiDAR and 2D vision domain gap. Freezing most DINOv2 layers preserves pre-trained knowledge during training, ensuring strong generalization and outperforming task-specific LPR networks.
2. **We introduce the Patch-InfoNCE loss**: A patch-level contrastive loss to enhance the local discriminability and robustness of learned LiDAR features. We demonstrate that our patch-level contrastive learning strategy achieves a performance boost in LPR.
3. **ImLPR demonstrates versatility on multiple public datasets**: Outperforming SOTA methods. Furthermore, we also validate the importance of each component of the ImLPR pipeline, with code available post-review for robotics community integration.
